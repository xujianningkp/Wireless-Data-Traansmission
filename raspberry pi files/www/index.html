                <p><b>University of North Texas (UNT)</b> , based in Denton, is a public institution of higher education and research committed to a wide array of sciences, engineering fields, liberal arts, fine arts, performing arts, humanities, public policy, and graduate professional education. Ten colleges, two schools, an early admissions math and science academy for exceptional high-school-age students from across the state, and a library system comprise the university. North Texas was founded as a nonsectarian, coeducational, private teachers college in 1890; and, as a collaborative development in response to enrollment growth and public demand, its trustees ceded control to the state in 1899. In 1901, North Texas was formally adopted by the State.</p>

                <a class="subtitle2">Electrical Engineering</a>
                <p>UNT's Electrical Engineering department works to combine hands-on research, engaging faculty & top of the line facilities to provide you with the best education possible. Our multidisciplinary coursework will give you opportunities to solve problems by working with other engineering experts. </p>
        		<p>The electrical engineering field deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. It now covers a range of subtopics such as power, electronics, control systems, signal processing and telecommunications. Electrical engineering is a profession that uses science, technology, and problem-solving skills to design, construct, and maintain products, services, and information systems.</p>
                
                <a class="subtitle2">Weather Station</a>
                <p><b>UNT Weather Station</b> Environmental Monitoring Station (EMSAT) that is at the Greenbelt Trail. Currently, the data logger is acquiring soil moisture data. The data logger that is very old technology that needs to be updated.  Currently, there is no way for the information to get from EMSAT to UNT wirelessly.  A faculty or student has to go on site to EMSAT and retrieve the data from the greenbelt.  This task wastes time and money from the school.  When the EMSAT was initially set up, the engineers tried to transmit the data from EMSAT to Discovery Park but were not able to since the tower needed to reach over the trees. </p>
                <p>By the end of the project, the team hopes to create a tower to transfer data from EMSAT to UNT Discovery Park to save cost on transferring data.  By upgrading the current system, UNT staff should no longer have to travel to greenbelt, reducing travel costs and saving time.  </p>
